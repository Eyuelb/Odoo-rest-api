                In this episode, we will investigate how Plex.Earth uses Angular and Electron to build Map Explorer, a map editing tool. We will then apply similar techniques to integrate a simple Angular app with Electron and convert it to a desktop app. Finally, we will see how to leverage the Angular DI mechanism to maintain two different flavours of our app, web and desktop.
